  <h1>A Brief history of the Pendola Power Rankings</h1>
  <p>It all started one day in Fall quarter of 2015, because of a comment made by James, who ironically avoided the ranking system for the next several months. Are you happy now? I hope so.</p> 
  <p>He noted that we were not salty enough, and proposed that we keep rankings in order to become saltier. His brainchild developed into the quest to find a suitable ranking system, led by mathematicians Thomas (2%LF) and Dylan (asdf). Thomas was the first to invent his own shitty ELO system. </p> 
  <p>It quickly became apparent that this system was too volatile, and so we dubbed it the salt maker ranking, and supplemented our competitive scene with a standard ELO system. The salt maker rankings eventually became completely broken.</p> 
  <p>Then, one day, at a table in the Ortega dining commons, while staring at 2%LF's face, I decided that building this system would make for a nice project. And here we are. You're welcome. Special thanks to Kenny for his help.</p>
